# Ferry Automobile Navigation System

This project was developed as part of a team project (4 members, Summer 2025).  
The system is a C++ terminal-based reservation program for ferry clerks, handling reservations, vehicles, and vessels with a scroll-based text interface.  

## My Contributions
Within the team project, I worked on:  
- Implementing modules for creating and managing reservations, bookings, and deleting vessels  
- Handling license plate storage using fixed-length binary records  
- Coordinating version control and merges in Git with other team members  

## Features
- Terminal-based reservation system for ferry clerks  
- Supports adding, deleting, and managing vehicles and vessels  
- Scroll-based menu for easy navigation  
- Uses fixed-length binary records for data management  

## Tech Stack
- C++  
- Git (version control)
